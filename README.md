# Dinosaur-Island-Character-Level-Language-Modeling
Build a character-level text generation language model, to generate names for new breeds of dinosaurs! 
* Store text data for processing using an RNN
* Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
* Sample novel sequences in an RNN
* Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
* Applying gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients
